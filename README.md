# Saturation of 0-1 Matrices
Code for checking whether or not a given pattern is contained as a submatrix
inside another matrix and other tools related to saturation like checking for
witnesses. Relevant classes and functions are in `saturation.py`, while proofs
of the claims in our paper are provided in `proofs.py`.

Requires numpy.
